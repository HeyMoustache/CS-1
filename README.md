# CS-1

A CS-80-style synthesizer firmware for the M-VAVE FM-1: a sound module for a dawless rig, played over
MIDI (TRS or USB) from a sequencer such as the Novation Circuit Tracks.

CS-1 is a Yamaha CS-80 in spirit: eight voices of two channels each (I and II), every channel a VCO
(sawtooth and / or pulse with PWM, noise), a resonant high-pass and low-pass filter in series, a sine added after
the filters, a filter envelope (IL, AL, A, D, R), a VCA envelope (A, D, S, R) and the touch response (velocity
and pressure to brilliance and level); a sub oscillator to pitch, filter and level; the ring modulator; the
chorus / tremolo (stereo here); portamento and glissando, channel II detune, the initial pitch bend, keyboard
control, sustain modes I and II, brilliance and resonance levers, and the SELECT encoder as the ribbon. For a
sequencer with no hands: an auto after touch curve each note plays by itself, MIDI learn, a CC map for the Circuit
Tracks' macros, and clock sync. Effects beyond the instrument: a stereo delay with a tape character, a phaser,
and a Dattorro plate reverb with a shimmer at any interval. The 22 preset tones come from the owner's manual's
charts (`tools/gen_presets.py` says how they were read and mapped), and the voice was calibrated against a CS-80
emulation, one dry note at a time (`tools/compare_wav.py`). 52 sounds, 32 user presets, a documentation site with
the firmware running in the browser, and an installer in the browser.

## What it stands on

- [Dinghy](https://github.com/zvenson/dinghy) (zvenson): the minimal FM-1 firmware template, which is the
  [Felucca](https://github.com/hugelton/Felucca) / SLOOP platform (Leo Kuroshita, Hügelton Instruments; isod89).
- [FM-106](https://github.com/patttf/fm-106) (PatttF): the second core as an audio worker
  (`firmware/hal/fm1_multicore.h`, `firmware/src/audio_worker.h`) and MIDI IN on the TRS jack (`midi_uart.c`),
  ported onto the Dinghy tree here.

Everything is GPL-3.0-only; see `LICENSING.md`.

MIDI clock from the sequencer drives the delay's SYNC divisions (DELAY page) and the sub oscillator's (SUB OSC 2);
VINTAGE on PERFORM lets each voice drift a few cents on its own, as the voice cards did.

## The sounds

PRESETS (and program change) runs through these, then the 32 user slots; HOME + a key picks a tone for a channel,
ALGO steps along its row. The classic ones are recipes after what is documented about the records (which presets,
the technique), not transcriptions; they pair a row I tone with a row II tone as the instrument does, and most
carry the chorus, a touch of detune, an auto after touch curve and the plate. The last group is converted from
CS-80 V factory presets on a computer with the plugin installed: `tools/converted.txt` lists them with our names,
`tools/arturia_convert.py` reads each preset's panel and maps it through the same calibration as the manual's tones
(`tools/converted.json` keeps the values, so the build does not need the plugin), and `tools/level_converted.py`
evens out their loudness by measurement.

## Layout

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `firmware/src/cs1.c` | the app: the panel's pages, the screen, keys, MIDI, settings |
| `firmware/src/cs1_voice.h`, `cs1_dsp.h` | the voice (patch, envelopes, filters, the block render on both cores) and the fixed-point primitives |
| `firmware/gen/cs1_tables.h` | the voice's tables, from `tools/gen_tables.py` (committed; no FPU on the chip) |
| `firmware/gen/cs1_presets.h` | the CS-80's 22 preset tones, from `tools/gen_presets.py` (the manual's charts, with the mapping's assumptions) |
| `tools/wav_check.py` | pitch, level and harmonics of a host render: a change to the voice checked without ears |
| `firmware/src/platform.c` | the platform wiring (boot, USB, updater, audio ISR, settings, CPU1, TRS MIDI) |
| `firmware/hal/` | every hardware register access; nothing outside it touches a register (the build checks) |
| `tests/host.c`, `tests/run_host.sh` | the app on a computer: a scripted run that writes a WAV and screen PNGs |
| `web/emu/` | the browser emulator (Emscripten + AudioWorklet): play it, with Web MIDI in |
| `web/site/`, `web/site.css`, `tools/gen_docs.py` | the documentation site: overview and install, manual, sound design guide, a reference generated from the firmware's page table, with the emulator under `emu/` |
| `tools/build.py` | the device build (JieLi toolchain, in Docker on macOS) and the `.fwsc` package |
| `docs/` | `API.md` (what the platform offers), `RULES.md` (the chip's rules: no float, no 64-bit division) |

## Build and run on a computer

```sh
pip3 install Pillow
tests/run_host.sh          # -> build/host/cs1.wav, build/host/cs1-*.png
```

On macOS without the Xcode licence accepted, point the compiler at the Command Line Tools:
`DEVELOPER_DIR=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools tests/run_host.sh`.

## Play it in the browser, and the site

The firmware runs in an AudioWorklet against a fake FM-1, with the panel on the page and Web MIDI in and out
(Chrome or Edge). The documentation site wraps it: the pages in `web/site/`, a reference that `tools/gen_docs.py`
generates from the firmware's own page and sound tables, and the emulator under `emu/`. Needs Emscripten
(`tools/get_emsdk.sh` installs it into `~/.emsdk`, no Xcode or Homebrew) and Node for the test:

```sh
web/site/build.sh                # -> build/site/ (index, manual, sound, reference, img/, emu/)
node web/emu/emu_test.mjs        # the wasm in Node: boots, sounds, LEDs, MIDI, settings, determinism, cost
python3 tools/serve_web.py       # http://localhost:8000/  (the emulator at /emu/; Web MIDI needs localhost or https)
```

Click **Switch on**, then play the keys (mouse, touch, or the <kbd>Q</kbd> and <kbd>A</kbd> rows), turn the
knobs (drag or wheel), and pick your MIDI interface under **MIDI in** to play it from a sequencer. CC 80 to 87
and MIDI learn (REC) map a controller's knobs, as on the FM-1. `emu/?sound=N` opens a sound, which the site's
"Try" links use. The settings sector and the user bank are kept in the browser's localStorage; **Export presets**
writes the bank to a `.cs1bank` file. What the emulator cannot tell you: CPU cost on the real chip, the
dual-core split, USB audio and the updater.

`tests/run_tests.sh` runs the host build, the site build and the emulator test together. `build/site/` is the
whole site, ready for any static host (GitHub Pages included).

## Build for the FM-1

Needs the JieLi toolchain (`tools/get_toolchain.sh`), the AC79 SDK checkout, and Docker on macOS:

```sh
./build.sh                 # -> build/cs1.fwsc  (DINGHY_DUAL_CORE=0 ./build.sh for single-core)
python3 tools/fm1_install.py build/cs1.fwsc
```

The package identity is `FM-1_95N` (N = minor version). Installing any custom firmware is at your own risk:
hold OCT- at power-on for the USB rescue; M-VAVE's updater or the installer's "Return to official V15" takes
you back to stock.
